# Deep_Learning_Intro
This repository contains DL assignments as part of "Introduction to Deep Learning" course at BGU.

Each assignment followed by a report that describes the work done and presents the performances of the trained models.

-Assignment 1: implementation of a simple neural network with NumPy lib (Andrew NG style), also batch norm and dropout regularization methods.

-Assignment 2: one-shot image recognition via siamese neural networks (VGG16/VGG16face based).

-Assignment 3: creating a generative model that generates songs lyrics for a given melody.

The work was done with Eden Levy.
